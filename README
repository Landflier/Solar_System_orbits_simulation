################### REQUIREMENTS ####################

Project build requires cmake-3.16 at least

to download on local machine, run:
git clone --branch Added_numerical_integration_methods https://github.com/Landflier/Solar_System_rebased.git

As the project was developed using JetBrains CLion, there is included a .idea folder.

############# RUNNING THE PROJECT ###################

To execute the project, in the current directory, run
sh build.sh


###################### DATA #########################

data for the planets is downloaded from NASA : https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi#results
and stored in data/Planets_NASA directory.
To extract data run:

python3.7  data_extract

Solar_system_bodies.txt is used in the project as the input data
Solar_system_bodies.csv is just human readable csv, to see data

#################### RESULTS ########################


Running the project generates position/velocity data in the
data/Simulation_Results, in the form of two text files:

planets_p_q_python.txt :
        contains solar system for 5000 years with lines of
        each iteration concatenated (all q,v of planets).

        Later, this file is used in python_visualizations to illustrate
        the movement of the objects

system_variables_python.txt
        contains solar system for 5000 years with data of
        angular momentum (4-vector), center of mass (3-vector) and hamiltonian (scalar)



################# VISUALISATION #########################

In python_visualisation are 3 scripts, which use
the file data/Simulation_Results/planets_p_q_python.txt as input:

Graphs_of_system_variables.py
        creates graphs of:
            Hamiltonian and total angular momentum (modulus)
            orbit of center of mass for the system


orbits_plots.py
        plots orbits of all the object


visualise_second_version.py
        animates the orbits and creates a .mp4 file
